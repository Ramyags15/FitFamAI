    description: `
      Begin your morning practice by grounding your mind and body through slow, steady breathing.
      Focus on drawing air deeply into the belly, allowing your lungs to fully expand with each inhale.

      As you exhale, release any tension or heaviness from the night.  
      This simple practice helps regulate the nervous system, improve focus, and ease you gently into movement.
